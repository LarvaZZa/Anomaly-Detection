# Anomaly detection app

This Android application collects anomalies on the road and shows them on a map. The app is used on a bike to collect normal bike/road behaviour, and then detect deviations that occur on the road (bumps, potholes, etc). All the anomalies are collected and shown on Google Maps with a representative marker color indicating the confidende of the anomally occuring at that location.
